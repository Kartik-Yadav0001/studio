# **App Name**: Thread Weaver

## Core Features:

- Thread Pool Management: Dynamically manage a pool of threads to reduce creation overhead.
- Workload Distribution: Distribute computational tasks evenly across available threads.
- Mutex Lock Handling: Create and manage mutual exclusion locks to protect shared resources from race conditions during thread execution.
- Thread Synchronization: Allow safe management of multiple active threads to achieve concurrency.
- Graceful Thread Termination: Ensure that threads are terminated without causing data corruption.
- Thread Monitoring: Visualize simulated performance metrics to assist in identifying optimization opportunities, resource usage, and thread activity during runtime.
- Intelligent Thread Count Tool: Dynamically adjust the number of threads based on system load and application needs. Use generative AI to learn historical loads, incorporating other signals about current usage as tools in reasoning about future resource requests.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) for a sense of control and intelligence.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) to highlight key metrics and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for clean readability and a modern look.
- Use simple, scalable vector icons to represent threads and their status.
- A clear, well-organized dashboard layout with real-time thread monitoring and control panels.
- Subtle transitions to indicate thread status changes and workload distribution.
